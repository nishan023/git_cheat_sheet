# Renaming a Git Branch

This guide explains how to rename a Git branch both locally and remotely.

## Rename a Local Branch

1. **Switch to a Different Branch**

   - You cannot rename the branch you're currently on. Switch to a different branch (e.g., `main` or `master`):
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     ```

2. **Rename the Branch**
   - Use the `git branch -m` command to rename the branch. Replace `old-branch-name` with the current branch name and `new-branch-name` with the new name you want:
     ```bash
     git branch -m old-branch-name new-branch-name
     ```

## Rename a Remote Branch

1. **Push the Renamed Branch**

   - Push the newly named branch to the remote repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin new-branch-name
     ```

2. **Delete the Old Branch from Remote**

   - Remove the old branch name from the remote repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin --delete old-branch-name
     ```

3. **Update Your Local Repository**
   - If other team members have the old branch name, theyâ€™ll need to fetch the changes and update their references:
     ```bash
     git fetch origin
     ```

## Notes

- Make sure to inform your team about the branch rename to avoid confusion.
- Update any references to the old branch name in your project or documentation.
